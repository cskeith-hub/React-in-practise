# React in practise

- Repository: `react-in-practice`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `consolidation`
- Duration: `4+1 days`
- Deployment: `Github pages` or `Netlify`

## Intro

Last time, we saw how to use React hooks and create JSX components. We also saw how to route between components and pass
information through them.

Now, we can use that new knowledge to have some fun! 

## Instructions
You will have a week (4 days + 0.5 days to fix and finish) followed by a short presentation of your project.

You are free to choose a topic for your project (or use suggested projects below). But should not be spending more than an hour finding a topic!

**All topics need to have all the following requirements given below as well.**

### Requirements
> Using a router
> 
> Multiple pages/components.
> 
> Updating data on change/filter.
> 
> Loading data on page load.
> 
> Installing a package/library to use
> 
> Passing props through components.


#### Ideas (normal)
- Food ordering app
- Movie suggestion app
- Save your creative ideas' app (using filters, labels, toggles and CRUD logic)
- Calendar app
- Weather App (*if you already made one earlier in the course, think about making a more advanced app with multiple pages and options*)

#### Ideas (advanced)
- Photo gallery with firebase
- Create + collect an avatar app (e.g.: drag and drop features for clothes/styling)
- Snake/flappy bird (or other) game multiple levels and *pop-up modals*.

> Disclaimer: YouTube series can take a long time and come over as "the only way". Don't focus on tutorials over exercise, try out multiple options. Combine the two or look for a specific topic instead.

## Good luck and have fun!
